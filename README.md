## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9pQS0BhjnW70TIwoMydSbHvbarhgahvoQEIFi7s8NJRSZ7j0z8pGufoU9Vhb7213JHKU&usqp=CAU)

Pychat is a chat application which is left uncleared due the syntax problem and too much of abstraction over the thing we have just working. Since Bupd hates the abstraction django forces the abstraction on his throat so he left this project unfinished.

## Built With

This Project is built with Python, Django, and uses channels to communicate with the websockets.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project Just clone and Start Working.

### Installation

Use the below command to clone the repo locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bupd/pychat.git
```

## Usage

Tried to be an private open-source chat client. But failed enormously.
